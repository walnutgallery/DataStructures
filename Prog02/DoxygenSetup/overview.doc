 * \mainpage Overview
 *
 * \section overview Overview
 * Assignment 2 focuses on implementation of the Map ADT using a binary tree
 * implementation. Different from the class however, you will be implementing a
 * map extremely similar to the c++ stl map. As such, remember to look
 * <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map">here</a> if you are
 * confused on how certain operations are performed before posting a question to
 * piazza.
 *
 * Essentially, this assignment mainly focuses on implementation, but you must
 * turn in a report as well. The report focuses on analyzing Big-Oh and
 * performance of MySTL::map.
 *
 * If you have questions, or if something is unclear, please post on piazza.
 *
 * \section Programming Assignment
 * In this assignment, you need to implement all items which can be found under
 * <a href="todo.html">todos</a>, which is essentially all variants of find
 * operations, insert operations, erase operations, and finishing the
 * implementation for the node classes constructor and destructor.
 * You should also think about a good order to implement them in. I recommend:
 * - finder
 * - inserter
 * - Element access operations
 * - etc in any order
 *
 * After completing, feel free to remove each doxygen todo statement from the
 * code, this way you can keep track!
 *
 * Unit testing is provided to aid you in determining if your implementation is
 * correct, however, note the tests are not exhaustive! If all tests are
 * reported to pass, this is only part of the process. If you are not convinced
 * your code is correct, please add more tests.
 *
 * \section Report
 * Your report will include the objective of the assignment, a brief description
 * of your implementation and experiments, and discussion of your results. At a
 * minimum, your report should include the following sections:
 * - <b>Introduction</b>. In this section, state or describe the objective of
 *   the assignment, a statement about what you learned in the assignment, and a
 *   statement summarizing your results.
 * - <b>Implementation details</b>. Give a brief description of how you
 *   implemented the assignment, including what you learned.
 * - <b>Theoretical analysis</b>. In this section, you should provide an
 *   analysis of and theoretical discussion (i.e Big-Oh) for inserting a new
 *   element into your map. Please provide best, average, and worst case
 *   analysis and discuss when they occur.
 * - <b>Experimental Setup</b>. In this section, you should provide a
 *   description of your experiment setup, which includes but is not limited to
 *   Machine specification, i.e., processor type, amount of ram, OS, etc.
 * - <b>Results & Discussion</b>. In this section, you will experiment to
 *   perform n insert operations on an initially empty map. You will compare
 *   orderings of data including linear tree structure, complete tree structure,
 *   and randomized data. timing.cpp is already setup to generate all data you
 *   will need in your base experiments. Include and discuss the following
 *   plots:
 *     -# Plot input size vs. time / input size, i.e., amortized time on map
 *     insertion for each of the data sequences.
 *     -# Plot input size vs. (time / input size)/expected time for the three
 *     operations and determine the Big-Oh constants of an insert operation.
 *   For operations which take O(n^2) test the following input sizes: 2^1, ...,
 *   2^15. For operations which take O(log n) test the following input sizes:
 *   2^1, ..., 2^20 (use what is setup for you in timing.cpp).
 *
 *   For plot discussions think of this: what is presented in each plot (i.e.,
 *   explain the data), what conclusion to do see from the data (i.e., learn
 *   from the data), and connect the data back to your theoretical discussion.
 * - <b>Conclusion</b>. Summarize the results found in the experiment.
 *
 * \section bonus Bonus
 * Implement a self balancing mechanism for your Map ADT, e.g., AVL trees.
 * Augment your experiments and theoretical analysis to show how AVL performs
 * equally on the data sets in the regular assignment.
